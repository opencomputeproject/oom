optoe driver

Author Don Bollinger (don@thebollingers.org)

Optoe is an i2c based driver that supports read/write access to all
the pages (tables) of MSA standard SFP and similar devices (conforming
to the SFF-8472 specs) and MSA standard QSFP and similar devices
(conforming to the SFF_8436 specs).

This driver is derived from the sff_8436 driver written by Cumulus
Networks (thanks and kudos), which was derived from the at24 driver
in the Linux kernel.

i2c based optoelectronic transceivers (SPF, QSFP, etc) provide identification,
operational status, and control registers via an EEPROM model.  Unlike the
EEPROMs that at24 supports, these devices access data beyond byte 256 via
a page select register, which must be managed by the driver.  See the driver
code for a detailed explanation of how the linear address space provided
by the driver maps to the paged address space provided by the devices.

The EEPROM data is accessible via a bin_attribute file called 'eeprom',
e.g. /sys/bus/i2c/devices/24-0050>/eeprom

This driver also reports the port number for each device, via a sysfs
attribute: 'port_name'.  This is a read/write attribute.  It should be
explicitly set as part of system initialization, ideally at the same time
the device is instantiated.  Write an appropriate port name (any string, up
to 19 characters) to initialize.  If not initialized explicitly, all ports
will have the port_name of 'unitialized'.

This driver can be instantiated with 'new_device', per the convention
described in Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices.  It wants one of
two possible device identifiers.  Use 'optoe1' to indicate this is a device
with just one i2c address (all QSFP type devices).  Use 'optoe2' to indicate
this is a device with two i2c addresses (all SFP type devices).

Example:
# echo optoe1 0x50 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-64/new_device
# echo port54 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-64/port_name

This will add a QSFP type device to i2c bus i2c-64, and name it 'port54'

Example:
# echo optoe2 0x50 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-11/new_device
# echo port1 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-11/port_name

This will add an SFP type device to i2c bus i2c-11, and name it 'port1'

The second parameter to new_device is an i2c address, and MUST be 0x50 for
this driver to work properly.  This is part of the spec for these devices.
(It is not necessary to create a device at 0x51 for SFP type devices, the
driver does that automatically.)

Note that SFP type and QSFP type devices are not plug-compatible.  The
driver expects the correct ID for each port (each i2c device).  It does
not check because the port will often be empty, and the only way to check
is to interrogate the device.  Incorrect choice of ID will lead to correct
data being reported for the first 256 bytes, incorrect data after that.
